Hi guys, 

I just would like to ask a question about this part of documenatation 
https://jetstream.laravel.com/2.x/building-your-app.html ,
but not found proper place.

This code sample is great like whole Laravel docs
$request->session()->flash('flash.banner', 'Yay it works!');
$request->session()->flash('flash.bannerStyle', 'success');

but undestandable for me as beginner.
Where I can to put this code to?
If as responce, but ehre is request already...
Explaine please in the docs.
